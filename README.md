The project has 5 components to it : *Nav bar
*Home
*About
*Works
\*Contact info

---

## Nav bar

The nav bar has 2 components to it
the logo and the links. clicking on the logo reloads the page, while clicking on the components in the nav bar takes you to the corresponding page.

---

## Home

---

The home page is pretty simple, it has a hero image as a background and an introductory statement from me.

---

## About Me

---

the about me was pretty tricky to build, I had to seperate it into two contents(left and right) to be able to scale it as I want.

## Works

---

The works page is just my past projects that was commited to github, and it takes you to the project when you click the image

## Contact Me

The contact me was the most complicated, as it had a bunch of elements to it. currently the right side of the page does nothing as it doesn't link to anything. Hopefully it will change soon.
